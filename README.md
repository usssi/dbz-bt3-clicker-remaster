## About the Game

This project is a **remake and remaster** of the beloved loading screen mini-game from **Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3**, reimagined as a "juiced-up" incremental clicker game. What started as a simple game feel experiment in Unity evolved into a fuller experience.

The goal was to take the simple mechanic of Goku eating ramen bowls and push its presentation and engagement to the maximum using modern techniques, while respecting the style of the original assets (remastered for HD).

* **Full Title:** Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 - Loading Screen Goku Clicker Mini Game (REMASTER)
* [View on Itch.io (Play/Download Protoype)](https://ussi.itch.io/dbz-clicker)

## Features & Technical Details

* **Core Gameplay:** Frantic clicking based on the original ramen-eating mechanic.
* **Incremental Progression:** Features a store with upgrades to enhance clicking power and other stats, typical of clicker/idle games. Includes mechanics like a "Max Power" charge bar and random "Golden Plate" appearances for bonuses.
* **Enhanced Game Feel ("Juice"):** Implemented significant feedback elements including:
    * Camera shakes on clicks/events.
    * Impactful sound effects.
    * Particle effects for emphasis.
* **Visual Enhancements (Unity):**
    * **Custom Shaders:** Written in ShaderLab/HLSL for effects like screen distortion, color manipulation (e.g., during Max Power), and potentially enhancing the remastered original assets.
    * **Post-Processing:** Utilized Unity's post-processing stack for effects like bloom, vignette, color grading, etc., to enhance the visual flair.
    * **UI:** Significant UI work for the store and feedback elements, designed to fit the DBZ aesthetic.
* **Technology:**
    * Engine: **Unity**
    * Programming: **C#** (Core mechanics, UI logic, gameplay systems)
    * Shaders: **ShaderLab**, **HLSL**

## Development Note

This project began as a personal challenge and experiment focused purely on enhancing "game feel" for a very simple mechanic. It served as a practical exercise in implementing various visual and audio feedback techniques (juice), shaders, and post-processing within the Unity engine.
